A showcase of my consultancy projects across growth strategy, program management, market intelligence, and more.

## Integrating Geospatial Intelligence and AI agents into a Travel Agency’ Digital Strategy

Tasked with enhancing a digital strategy (apps, websites, paper maps) for a travel agency, I developed a strategic roadmap for incorporating geographic data—maps, points of interest (POIs), and routes—into their digital channels. This included refining their GTM strategy and identifying key integration opportunities to create a seamless, data-enriched user experience, positioning them for long-term competitive advantage. This included working towards a longer term vision of integrating AI agents for smarter searching and automated booking.

## Driving AI Innovation in Autonomous Mobility Research

Collaborating with a leading technical university, I played a key role in securing consortia partners for a research initiative focused on self-driving vehicles and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). My contributions spanned from identifying industry partners with real-world use cases to structuring the project proposal, defining the financial framework, and developing a comprehensive dissemination plan. This strategic approach positioned the university’s research at the forefront of establishing an ELSA Lab (Ethical-Legal-Societal Aspects).

## Transforming Market Intelligence Through AI-Driven Data Solutions

In an internal initiative, I led the development of a dynamic market intelligence platform for the AD/ADAS supply chain. By structuring extensive market research data into a graph database and integrating it with a chat-based AI interface, I enabled seamless data accessibility. This innovation improved strategic decision-making capabilities and enhanced the organization’s ability to navigate the evolving landscape of autonomous driving technology.

## Facilitating Market Expansion Through Strategic Joint Ventures

For a multinational leader in ADAS V&V, I spearheaded the exploration of a joint venture (JV) in a high-growth geographical market to expand the reach of their core service: critical scenario simulation. Leveraging both primary and secondary market research, I applied strategic frameworks to identify the best-fit local partners. Through a rigorous SWOT analysis, I refined an initial partner candidate list down to a highly qualified shortlist. This strategic approach provided the client with a strong foundation for the next phase of JV discussions.

## Unlocking Scalable Growth for Fleet Management Software

A mid-sized fleet management software provider faced stagnation, with early-stage products failing to meet projected growth figures. Engaged to diagnose and resolve the challenge, I conducted an in-depth assessment of their market positioning and business models. Through this ongoing engagement, I identified eight high-impact growth strategies designed to elevate the company within the value chain and significantly boost revenue potential.

## Pivoting Strategy for an Automotive Mapping Startup

Supporting a startup specializing in mapping solutions for automotive clients, I facilitated a strategic pivot to align with both customer needs and investor expectations. I designed and led a targeted workshop covering customer pain points, value proposition refinement, business model adaptation, product and IP strategy, and necessary investments. The insights gained were synthesized into a revised business plan, resulting in an adapted go-to-market (GTM) strategy and a favorable reassessment by investors.
