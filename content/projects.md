A showcase of my consultancy projects across growth strategy, program management, market intelligence, and more.

## Integrating Geospatial Intelligence and AI agents into a Travel Agency’ Digital Strategy

_June 2024 - June 2025_

Tasked with enhancing a digital strategy (apps, websites, paper maps) for a travel agency, I developed a strategic roadmap for incorporating geographic data—maps, points of interest (POIs), and routes—into their digital channels. This included refining their GTM strategy and identifying key integration opportunities to create a seamless, data-enriched user experience, positioning them for long-term competitive advantage. This included working towards a longer term vision of integrating AI agents for smarter searching and automated booking.

## Trailblazer and innovation manager at colab.nl

_September 2024 - March 2025_

I explored how tele-operated robots could add value in schools and healthcare. In schools, the robot enabled remote teaching by home-bound teachers. In healthcare, we tested roles like a reception assistant or a companion ("maatje"). This project was part of colab.nl—a user-driven innovation track focused on creating tech people actually use. By involving end users from the start, colab.nl aims to turn promising concepts into real-world solutions that are intuitive, inclusive, and impactful. Within this project, I was responsible for managing the tech core including the robot, front-end, and back-end.

## Driving AI Innovation in Autonomous Mobility Research

_June 2024 - December 2024_

Collaborating with a leading technical university, I played a key role in securing consortia partners for a research initiative focused on self-driving vehicles and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). My contributions spanned from identifying industry partners with real-world use cases to structuring the project proposal, defining the financial framework, and developing a comprehensive dissemination plan. This strategic approach positioned the university’s research at the forefront of establishing an ELSA Lab (Ethical-Legal-Societal Aspects).

## Transforming Market Intelligence Through AI-Driven Data Solutions

_November 2023 - June 2024_

In an internal initiative, I led the development of a dynamic market intelligence platform for the AD/ADAS supply chain. By structuring extensive market research data into a graph database and integrating it with a chat-based AI interface, I enabled seamless data accessibility. This innovation improved strategic decision-making capabilities and enhanced the organization’s ability to navigate the evolving landscape of autonomous driving technology.

## Facilitating Market Expansion Through Strategic Joint Ventures

_August 2023 - November 2023_

For a multinational leader in ADAS V&V, I spearheaded the exploration of a joint venture (JV) in a high-growth geographical market to expand the reach of their core service: critical scenario simulation. Leveraging both primary and secondary market research, I applied strategic frameworks to identify the best-fit local partners. Through a rigorous SWOT analysis, I refined an initial partner candidate list down to a highly qualified shortlist. This strategic approach provided the client with a strong foundation for the next phase of JV discussions.

## Evaluation of European drone market for entry into Japan

_June 2023 - August 2023_

Conducted an internal project to evaluate the European drone market, focusing on companies aiming to enter the Japanese market with their drone solutions. The project involved a comprehensive market analysis from both technical and business perspectives, identifying key opportunities and challenges for European companies in Japan. My work included assessing market demand, competitive landscape, regulatory considerations, and potential partnerships, providing strategic insights to support successful market entry and growth in the Japanese drone sector.

## Next generation HD maps for L4+ AD systems

_April 2023_

For a market research firm, I’ve provided market insights and ideas on next-generation HD maps for use within L4+ autonomous driving systems.

Outcome: insights which directly can be integrated into the client’ research reports, ranging from state-of-the-art mapping models to future developments on semantic metadata supporting hands off, eyes off driving.

Keywords: SD map, HD map, ADAS map, competitive analysis, Mobileye, TomTom, Here, Woven Planet, Dynamic Map Platform, NVidia (Deepmap), automotive OEMs.

## Unlocking Scalable Growth for Fleet Management Software

_January 2023 - June 2023_

For Astrata Europe (nowadays rebranded to AddSecure), a company delivering fleet management software and analytics services with global presence, I’ve evaluated its go-to-market strategy, identified bottlenecks, and developed tactics to grow its business.

Outcome: so far 8 growth tactics which will enable my client to significantly increase its revenue figures by moving up into the value chain with some of its offerings.

Keywords: SWOT analysis, competitive analysis, subscription based business models, fleet data protocols, fleet management workflows, driving behavior and scoring, value proposition & roadmapping, metrics, product bundling, business scaling & repeatability.

## Pivoting Strategy for an Automotive Mapping Startup

_January 2023_

Supporting a startup specializing in mapping solutions for automotive clients, I facilitated a strategic pivot to align with both customer needs and investor expectations. I designed and led a targeted workshop covering customer pain points, value proposition refinement, business model adaptation, product and IP strategy, and necessary investments. The insights gained were synthesized into a revised business plan, resulting in an adapted go-to-market (GTM) strategy and a favorable reassessment by investors.
