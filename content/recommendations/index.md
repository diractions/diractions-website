Here are a few recommendations I've received from my clients and colleagues:

## Gwen van Vugt

_Senior Director @ Siemens | Head of Simcenter Autonomy_

"I’m delighted to recommend Harald Hagenaars. We’ve known each other for many years in the mobility innovation domain, and I’ve consistently experienced Harald as an genuine, insightful professional who is easy to engage with and excellent to spar with. When he launched his independent practice Diractions Consulting, I was one of his first clients, and he executed that assignment exceptionally well.

Harald never jumps to conclusions. He tackles challenges in a structured way, conducts thorough research, and uses his extensive network to bring additional perspectives and value. He presents clearly and concisely at executive level, keeps stakeholders aligned, and follows up diligently to ensure momentum and concrete outcomes.

In short: Harald is a pleasure to work with and delivers high-quality results. I recommend him without reservation."

He will surely be a great asset for any company to have by your side."
