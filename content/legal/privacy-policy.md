**Effective date: 01-07-2025**

Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy outlines how I collect, use, and protect your personal data when you visit [diractions.eu](https://diractions.eu) and [diractions.nl](https://diractions.nl).

## 1. Who I am

This website is operated by Harald Hagenaars, based in The Netherlands.  
You can contact me at: [harald@diractions.eu](mailto:harald@diractions.eu).

## 2. What Personal Data I collect and why

### a. Analytics

I use **Google Analytics** to understand how visitors use my sites (e.g., which pages are viewed, time spent on pages, bounce rate). This data is anonymized and does not include personal identifiers.

Google may collect your IP address and use cookies to track your usage.  
Learn more: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

You can opt out using this tool:  
[https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

### b. Embedded Content from Other Websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, tweets, or articles). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if you visited those websites directly.

These external sites **may collect data about you**, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with the embedded content — especially if you have an account and are logged in to that service.

I do **not control** the privacy practices of those websites. I recommend reviewing their privacy policies before interacting with their content.

### c. Contact or Email

If you contact me via email, I will only use your information to respond to your inquiry. I do not store or share your personal data beyond that purpose.

## 3. No User Accounts

I do **not** offer user accounts, comments, newsletter subscriptions, or any feature that requires you to submit personal information via the website.

## 4. Cookies

I do not use cookies for advertising, personalization, or social sharing.  
The only cookies in use are those set by **Google Analytics** or embedded third-party content. See my [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookie-policy/) for more details.

## 5. Data Sharing

I do **not** share your personal data with third parties, except where data is collected by embedded content (see above) or analytics providers (Google).

## 6. Data Retention

I do not retain personal data unless you contact us directly. Analytics data is retained according to Google’s default retention settings.

## 7. Your Rights

Under GDPR (if applicable), you have the right to:

- Access the personal data I may hold about you
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data
- Object to data processing
- Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority

To make a request, contact me at [harald@diractions.eu](mailto:harald@diractions.eu).

## 8. Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page with an updated effective date.
