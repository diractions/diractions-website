Why do so many AI and robotics projects fail?

Engineers get excited about the latest robot navigation breakthroughs. Meanwhile, business leaders keep asking:

‚ÄúBut where‚Äôs the ROI?‚Äù

A recently recorded [Lean Startup podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_OJgJM6ags) perfectly captured what I‚Äôve seen for years as a consultant in AI and robotics.

The guest, [Siddarth Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAKR2P0BzSJsLU4TRegiCDHaab_QwVHFV0c?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BmLt9k5e0Q2CNcEWSN3gvew%3D%3D), nailed the core issue:

üî• There‚Äôs a massive disconnect between business leaders (focused on outcomes) and tech teams (focused on data, models, and tools).

So what‚Äôs missing?

üëâ The AI Product Manager‚Äîsomeone who speaks both languages and bridges the gap.

Oddly, when I look at open roles in companies aiming to integrate AI or robotics, I rarely see job postings for this kind of product leader.

Instead, I see positions for ML engineers, data scientists, or traditional PMs‚Äîwith no mention of lean experimentation, hypothesis testing, or rapid validation.

It‚Äôs a blind spot. And it‚Äôs costing teams time, money, and trust.

For over 10 years, I‚Äôve applied lean startup thinking to AI projects, and these principles guide every engagement:

‚ú® Start with customer problems, not cool algorithms

‚ú® Validate solutions through fast, cheap prototypes

‚ú® Focus on business OKRs, not F1 scores

‚ú® Facilitate real collaboration between product, data, and business

‚ú® Drive iteration from real-world feedback‚Äînot internal assumptions

Traditional PMs write specs and plan roadmaps.

_Lean AI PMs test hypotheses, validate with real users, and iterate fast._

Less time in conference rooms or behind a desk, more time getting feedback that stings.

Curious‚Äîhave you seen this pattern too?

What‚Äôs worked (or failed) in your experience aligning AI innovation with customer value? [I am eager to connect with you and hear about your experiences.](#popup).
