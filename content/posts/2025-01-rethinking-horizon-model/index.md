A managing director of one of my clients has asked me a good question:

_“We’ve been running some early-stage innovation projects. They're not growing in getting traction as we expected. How do we bring these Horizon 3 ideas into Horizon 1 faster?”_

Here’s my take.

## The three horizons still matter

First, a quick note. There’s a popular article that argues the McKinsey Three Horizons model is outdated. [You can read it here](https://hbr.org/2019/02/mckinseys-three-horizons-model-defined-innovation-for-years-heres-why-it-no-longer-applies).

The critique makes sense in some situations. Especially in fast-moving industries. Some ideas do jump straight from concept to market. Think of new software features, or consumer tech products launched via crowdfunding.

But in most cases, you still need the long view. Especially if you’re working on innovations that depend on deep tech, new hardware (in my world for example: new sensors, actuators or edge computing devices), or academic research. These things take time. They move along the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) scale slowly. Sometimes you start with a master’s student project or a startup partner to drive disruptive opportunities. That’s Horizon 3. And it’s valid to spend enough time in this Horizon to validate and iterate.

The real challenge is not whether the model still applies. It’s how you move across the horizons with more speed and focus.

## So how do you go faster from Horizon 3 to 1?

Here’s what I’ve seen work.

### 1. Cut the hobby projects

Look at your current Horizon 3 portfolio. How many of these are just “interesting” experiments or "brainfarts"? Kill those.

Only keep the ones that:

- Solve a real customer problem.
- Fit your company’s future direction.
- Have a clear path to a market, including some validated findings as a gutfeeling that the innovation is able to scale.

This sounds harsh, but it’s necessary. You’re not a research institute.

### 2. Tie H3 to H1 early

Don’t treat your horizon projects as separate worlds. The faster route is when you connect them from the start.

That means:

- Collaborate with H1 business units early, so they don’t see the idea as “not invented here.”.
- Define what a future H1 version might look like, even roughly.
- Let internal teams co-develop or shadow the H3 work.

The more you involve the people who’ll eventually run it, the less friction later.

### 3. Set a decision gate based on learning, not time

Don’t let H3 projects drag on for years. But don’t rush to commercialize either.

Set a clear decision point. For example:

- “If we can show a working prototype that beats today’s tech on speed or cost by month 6, we move to pilot.”.
- “If we can’t find a market partner by Q4, we stop.”.

Use learning milestones and apply innovation accounting, don't set arbitrary deadlines.

### 4. Give them a soft landing

Sometimes a H3 idea is good and has validated hypotheses, but your H1 core business isn’t ready to adopt it. But you still invested in it.

In that case:

- Spin it off as a startup.
- License it.
- Partner with someone who is ready to carry it forward.

The goal is to keep momentum. Even if it’s not inside your company.

### Have one person own the handover

The handover from H3 to H1 often fails because nobody owns it. H3 teams don’t know how to scale. H1 teams don’t want the risk.

Appoint someone whose job is to push the idea through the funnel. Think of them as a “transition lead.” They don’t need to build the tech. But they do need to make sure it doesn’t get stuck.

### Last thought

You can’t force every Horizon 3 idea into Horizon 1. But you can increase the odds.

Be ruthless about what’s worth pursuing. Create bridges early. And assign people who know how to bring things home.

It’s not a straight line. But it’s doable.

And sometimes, speed is just about deciding faster.

Did you implement a 3 Horizon model in your organization? [I am eager to connect with you and hear about your experiences.](#popup)
