### My Story - From Innovation Labs to Strategic Advisory

I’ve spent the past three decades immersed in innovation — from the first consumer Internet on TV application, to building next-gen automotive systems and ADAS standardization, to scaling deep tech ventures across Europe and Asia. I’ve led strategic initiatives, built partnerships, co-founded a computer vision startup, and advised on investments in AI, sensors, and cybersecurity.

Looking back, the common thread is clear: helping organizations move from idea to adoption — not just creating innovation, but embedding it where it matters.

### Why I Started Diractions

After exiting my startup in 2023, I launched Diractions — a consulting firm helping organizations turn innovation into real-world value. The name blends “directions” and “actions”: strategic clarity, turned into results.

Based near Eindhoven, The Netherlands, I work with clients navigating complexity — from early-stage pilots to scalable ecosystems.

### My Approach

I specialize in companies working between TRL 4–9 — where ideas are proven technically, but not yet commercially. I help align product, business model, and go-to-market — bridging top-down strategy with bottom-up execution.

If you’re looking to translate vision into traction — or traction into scale — [let’s talk](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/7707e0a792da45c09c4ad255ec9e7fc8%40diractions.eu/meetingtype/1xCPAXDW9EyvUoRqSIpMDA2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled=true).
