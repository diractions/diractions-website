## My Story - From Innovation Labs to Strategic Advisory

I’ve spent the past three decades immersed in innovation — from the first consumer [Internet on TV application](https://novahollandia.nl/retro-gaming-consoles/cd-i-internet-pakket/), to building next-gen automotive systems and [ADAS standardization](https://adasis.org/), to scaling deep tech ventures across Europe and Asia. I’ve led strategic initiatives, built partnerships, co-founded a [computer vision startup](https://aiim.ai), and advised on investments in AI, sensors, and cybersecurity.

Looking back, the common thread is clear: helping organizations move from idea to adoption. Not just creating innovation, but embedding it where it matters.

## Why I Started Diractions

After exiting my [startup](https://aiim.ai) in 2023, I launched Diractions — a consulting firm helping organizations turn innovation into real-world value. The name blends “directions” and “actions”: strategic clarity, turned into results.

Based near Eindhoven, The Netherlands, I work with clients navigating complexity — from early-stage pilots to scalable ecosystems.

## My Approach

I specialize in companies working between [TRL 4–9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level). Where ideas are proven technically, but not yet commercially. I help align product, business model, and go-to-market — bridging top-down strategy with bottom-up execution. My approach is shaped by 30+ years of working across software, product, corporate development, and startup innovation. I’ve been inside the machine — building, scaling, and integrating innovation — not just advising from the outside.

What sets me apart is the way I connect technical depth with business strategy, and visionary thinking with operational pragmatism. I don’t stop at concepts — I work with you until the idea is validated, adopted, and delivering value.

If you’re looking to translate vision into traction — or traction into scale — [let’s talk](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/7707e0a792da45c09c4ad255ec9e7fc8%40diractions.eu/meetingtype/1xCPAXDW9EyvUoRqSIpMDA2?anonymous&ismsaljsauthenabled=true).

## Summary of what I offer

### Experience

With over 30 years of experience across software development, systems architecture, product strategy, and corporate development, I bring both technical depth and business fluency. I’ve worked across functions and levels, including advising C-level leaders, always asking the questions that drive sound, forward-looking decisions.

### Focus

I work within a clearly defined set of markets and services, allowing me to continuously refine and deepen my impact. Each new project builds on hard-earned lessons from earlier ones, creating cumulative value that benefits every client I work with.

### Outcome-oriented

Every engagement begins by clarifying the outcome that matters most. I focus on uncovering the problem behind the problem, listening closely and working backwards from the result that creates real value for the client.

### Network

Over two decades in automotive and intelligent mobility, and more recently in adjacent sectors like robotics and intralogistics, have given me access to a broad network of partners, suppliers, and innovators across the value chain.

### Pragmatism

I take a hands-on, down-to-earth approach with a strong bias toward action and results. While I draw from [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup), [Corporate Startup](https://thecorporatestartupbook.com/), and other proven methods, I never follow them blindly. Every engagement is tailored to what actually solves the client’s pain points.
